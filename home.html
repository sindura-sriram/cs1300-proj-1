            <figcaption style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 40px;"> <br> The goal of a lighter is to safely provide flame when handled with enough force. As such, a user has to apply both
              sufficient speed and force to the sparkwheel, and then kept the button held down for as long as the flame is desired.

          <p>To find out, I observed three people using a lighter and asked them these basic questions:</p>
          <ol class = "questions">
            <li>Have you used a lighter before?</li>
            <li>Does a lighter fit properly in your hand?</li>
            <li>How many times do you think you will take to successfully light the lighter? <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(asked before observation)</li>
            <li>How many times did it actually take to light it? <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(asked after observation)</li>
            <li>How do you tell when a lighter is out of fluid?</li>
            <li>If you could invest in an electric lighter, would you?</li>
            <li>How would you describe your technique for lighting a lighter to someone else?</li>
            <li>Have you ever injured yourself with a lighter?</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="observations">
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy selection of users each had varying degrees of familiarlity with the product, making them a good representation
              of the general populace. My users expressed that they found the design somewhat intuitive and easy to grip, but that
              it took practice to actually be able to use it. Specifically, users with some prior experience all underestimated the number
              of attempts that they would take, and my user with no experience surrounding lighters was unable to light the flame after 6 attempts. 
              Most of my users admitted that they had injured themselves at least once while using lighters.</p>
            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI personally observed that most users had difficulty lighting the flame on their first try, regardless of their professed
              expertise. I saw that all of my users were able to easily grip the lighter, and everyone intuitively knew how to
              properly hold it. The technique for lighting the lighter, however, was observably not so intuitive.

          <p>I represented what I heard from the responses in the form of two personas, shown below using empathy maps.
            Here are Burnt Bethany and Cheap Charlie, two archetypal lighter users.</p>

                  Burnt Becky is a working woman who is searching for a way to help her relax at the end of a long week.
                  She likes cigarettes, but can't properly light a lighter. She
                  usually takes Advil for her headaches, but lately they've been
                  making her constipated, and she finds herself constantly stressed, even when
                  she doesn't have deadlines to meet.

                <p class = "persona_p">Cheap Charlie is a frugal college student who does not like to waste anything. 
                  He considers himself environmentally and socially conscious and often advocates
                  for various social issues. He works a part-time job and budgets his finances 
                  by the week, never spending a cent above what he has allocated for himself.

          <p>Based on Burnt Bethany's empathy map, I created a storyboard depicting what might be her typical evening after work.</p>
